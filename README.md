## Appendix

* [Opensource](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) means that you can access it at any time for free and that the code is open for public viewing. Github whilst has a closed liscence has opensourced code. Opensource programs and applications can be used by anybody without liscence and sometimes out preforms private liscensed software, programs, or applications. Opensourced programs generally require a pre-requist of some degree of existing knowledge before open sourced programs can be used. They are peer reviewed. 

* [Private Use](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/private-use) means that you can only use a certain program, application, or code within a private application sphere. It cannot be monetized in any way.

* [Commercial Use](https://www.lawinsider.com/clause/commercial-use) means you can use it for commerical projects, and therefore can make money from it.
